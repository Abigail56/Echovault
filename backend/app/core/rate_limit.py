"""A small in-memory sliding-window rate limiter for auth endpoints.

Limitation: counters live in this process only. With several API worker
processes or servers, each keeps its own counts. That is acceptable for a
single-instance deployment; a shared store (e.g. Redis) would be needed beyond
that.
